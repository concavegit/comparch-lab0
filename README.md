Test case 1

Positive overflow

5+3 

Due to the structure of 2 complements with 4 bits, we see overflow into negative numbers when the sum of 2 positive numbers is over 7



Test case 2

Negative overflow

-7-2 

Due to the structure of 2 complements with 4 bits, we see overflow into positive numbers when the sum of 2 negative numbers is below -8


Test case 3


Postive addition

5+2 

This is regular positive adddition, where we add 2 postive numbers to get a positive number.


Test case 4

Negative addition

-3+-5 

This is regular negative adddition, where we add 2 negative numbers to get a negative number.


Test case 5

Extreme 1

7+0

This is an extreme case, where the highest positive number is added to zero.


Test case 6

Extreme 2

)+&

This is an extreme case, where zero is added to the highest positive number to test the commutative property.


Test case 7

Extreme 3

7+7

This is an extreme case, where the highest positive number is added to itself to check peak overflow.


Test case 8

Extreme 4

-8+0

This is an extreme case, where the highest negative number is added to zero.


Test case 9

Extreme 5

0+-8

This is an extreme case,where zero is added to the highest negative number to test the commutative property.

Test case 10

Extreme 6

-8-8

This is an extreme case, where the highest negative number is added to itself to check peak negative overflow.



Test case 11

Extreme 7

0+0

This is an extreme case, where zero is added to itself.


Test case 12

(Larger)Positive + (Smaller)Negative 

5-3

A case where a postive number is added to a smaller negative one.

Test case 13

(Smaller)Positive + (Larger)Negative 

5+-6

A case where a postive number is added to a larger negative one.

Test case 14

(Smaller)Negative + (Larger)Positive 

-3+6

A case where a negative number is added to a larger positive one.

Test case 15

(Larger)Negative + (Smaller)Positive 

-6+3

A case where a negative number is added to a smaller positive one.
